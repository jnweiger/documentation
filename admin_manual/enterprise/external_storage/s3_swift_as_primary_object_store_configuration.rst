Configuring S3 as Primary Storage
=================================

In ownCloud Enterprise edition, administrators can configure S3 objects as the primary storage.
Doing this replaces the default ownCloud ``owncloud/data`` directory.

You may still need to keep the ``owncloud/data`` directory for these reasons:

* The ownCloud log file is saved in the data directory
* Legacy apps may not support using anything but the ``owncloud/data`` directory

Administrators can move their ownCloud log file, by changing its location in ``config.php``.
However, even when this is done, ``owncloud/data`` may still be required for backward compatibility with some apps.

Implications
------------

- Apply this configuration before the first login of any user â€“ including the admin user; otherwise, ownCloud can no longer find the user's files.

- ownCloud, in "object store" mode, expects exclusive access to the object store container, because it only stores the binary data for each file.

.. note:: While in this mode, ownCloud stores the metadata in the local database for performance reasons.

- The current implementation is incompatible with any app that uses direct file I/O (input/output) as it circumvents the ownCloud virtual filesystem. Two excellent examples are:

  #. **The Encryption app:** It fetches critical files in addition to any requested file, which results in significant overhead.
  #. **The Gallery app:** It stores thumbnails directly in the filesystem.

Configuration
-------------

Look in ``config.sample.php`` for example configurations.
Copy the relevant part to your ``config.php`` file.
Any object store needs to implement ``\\OCP\\Files\\ObjectStore\\IObjectStore``, and can be passed parameters in the constructor with the ``arguments`` key, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: php

    'objectstore' => [
        'class' => 'Implementation\\Of\\OCP\\Files\\ObjectStore\\IObjectStore',
        'arguments' => [
            ...
        ],
    ],

Amazon S3
~~~~~~~~~

The S3 backend mounts a bucket of the Amazon S3 object store into the virtual filesystem.
The class to be used is ``OCA\Files_Primary_S3\S3Storage``, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: php

  'objectstore' => [
      'class' => 'OCA\Files_Primary_S3\S3Storage',
      'arguments' => [
          // replace with your bucket
          'bucket' => 'owncloud',
          'autocreate' => true,
          // uncomment to enable server side encryption
          //'serversideencryption' => 'AES256',
          'options' => [
              // version and region are required
              'version' => '2006-03-01',
              // change to your region
              'region'  => 'eu-central-1',
              'credentials' => [
                  // replace key and secret with your credentials
                  'key' => 'EJ39ITYZEUH5BGWDRUFY',
                  'secret' => 'M5MrXTRjkyMaxXPe2FRXMTfTfbKEnZCu+7uRTVSj',
              ],
          ],
      ],
  ],


Ceph S3
~~~~~~~

The S3 backend can also be used to mount the bucket of a Ceph S3 object store via the S3 API into the virtual filesystem.
The class to be used is ``OCA\Files_Primary_S3\S3Storage``:

.. code-block:: php

    'objectstore' => [
        'class' => 'OCA\Files_Primary_S3\S3Storage',
        'arguments' => [
            // replace with your bucket
            'bucket' => 'owncloud',
            'autocreate' => true,
            'options' => [
                // version and region are required
                'version' => '2006-03-01',
                'region'  => '',
                // replace key, secret and bucket with your credentials
                'credentials' => [
                    // replace key and secret with your credentials
                    'key'    => 'EJ39ITYZEUH5BGWDRUFY',
                    'secret' => 'M5MrXTRjkyMaxXPe2FRXMTfTfbKEnZCu+7uRTVSj',
                ],
                // replace the ceph endpoint with your rgw url
                'endpoint' => 'http://cephhost:8000/',
                // Use path style when talking to ceph
                'command.params' => [
                    'PathStyle' => true,
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
